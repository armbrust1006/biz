                        <p>There are two ways to look at this question. If you are looking to cut the costs you can do the updates yourself. The website will be in CMS and you will get the instructions on how you can update it by yourself. If you would like us to do the updates for you, we will do it and not only will we update the content, but also work on search engine optimization. That way your website will be up to date, and you will get more visitors over time.</p>

Then we will take these keywords and analyze them using our database tools. We will find out how many people use them and how many websites already used these keywords. That way we will know how many companies you are competing with. Also, we will get information on similar search terms that can be used and that can help us make changes and get better solutions for you. We will tailor the key phrases to fit your needs, taking your goals and budget into account. This first part of our cooperation will be a bit intense in communication. After the first few rounds of calls and e-mails we wont be bugging you as much and will have enough info to finish the work ourselves.</p>
